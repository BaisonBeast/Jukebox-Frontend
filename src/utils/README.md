# Utility Functions

## Conventions

Utility functions must be pure, and no state should ever be be affected by them. All
functions should take in input and give a predictable output each time.

### Naming

When naming util functions, should follow: `action` `input` `output`()

Ex: `getCurrentDate()`, `convertStringToNum()`
